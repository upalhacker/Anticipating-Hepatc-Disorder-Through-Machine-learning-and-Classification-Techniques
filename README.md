# Anticipating-Hepatc-Disorder-Through-Machine-learning-and-Classification-Techniques

**Hepatitis is a global health problem accounting for a significant portion of global
mortality. Although common, liver diagnosis is still a difficult and often expensive operation that
requires complex clinical procedures and expertise. Machine learning (ML) technology holds
promise against this challenge by using a data-driven approach to predict and diagnose diseases
more accurately and efficiently. Here we aim to develop an effective liver disease prediction
model by applying the power of machine learning algorithms on the Indian Liver Disease Patient
Dataset. Using a variety of supervised learning algorithms logistic regression, K-nearest
neighbors, support vector machine, and random forest, we aim to increase accuracy and
ultimately improve patient outcomes.
Additionally, we created a web interface using the lightweight Python web Flask to
deliver training models and provide users with a seamless and intuitive liver prediction platform.
We saw differences in accuracy between the tested algorithms some models perform better than
others. After rigorous analysis and comparison, we identified the Logistic Regression provide
high accuracy this prediction model is implemented as a web application using Flask.
The user interface provides physicians and patients with a simple tool to predict liver
disease, the ability to make early diagnoses, and interventions to improve patient outcomes and
reduce medical costs. It has the ability to change liver disease. Using the Indian Liver Disease
Dataset and employing highly trained observers, we developed a robust predictive model to
improve the accuracy and accessibility of liver disease diagnosis. The integrated user interface
further simplifies the deployment and use of predictive models, bridging regulatory challenges
between machine learning technology and end user**
